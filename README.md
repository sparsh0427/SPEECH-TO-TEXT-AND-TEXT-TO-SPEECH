# SPEECH-TO-TEXT-AND-TEXT-TO-SPEECH
Basically i have created a very basic 2-3 conversation lines between a client and machine(like google assistant) using VARIOUS LIBRARIES AVAILABLE IN PYTHON. You can make it more advance by adding more features to it. It was basically my first progrrame in SPEECH TO TEXT AND TEXT TO SPEECH RECOGNITION.
